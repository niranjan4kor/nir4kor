# Building multi-stage image (Optional)
There might be a need from developer to use multi-stage build. Using such an approach, would speed up the completion of CI Workflow, in case python wheels have to be compiled. To achieve that below solution provides prebuild base image, which does not need to be build on every CI run.

## How does it work?

**Files:**
* seatadjuster (Dockerfile, Dockerfile.base)
  * Base image is build and pushed to the git repository. While building application image (Dockerfile), prebuilt base image will be used.
* vehicleapi (Dockerfile, Dockerfile.base)
  * Base image is build and pushed to the git repository. While building application image (Dockerfile), prebuilt base image will be used.
* workflow (build_base_images.yml)

**Get it running:**
* Copy workflow file (build_base_images.yml) to ```.github/workflows```
* Create Dockerfile and Dockerfile.base for **seatadjuster** files in: ```/src```

* Login to Github platform and execute the workflow

## Troubleshooting:
In case of building multi-stage images locally, Docker and Git needs to be configured.

**Docker/ Git configuration:**
* Generate token: ```Github -> UserAccount -> Settings -> Developer Settings -> Personal Access token```
* Once token is issued, click: ```Configure SSO -> Authorize -> Software Defined Vehicle```
* In console type: ```docker login ghcr.io```
* Use generated token to authenticate
* To build file locally, find commands in: ```scripts/k3d/03_deploy.k3d.sh```

### Building staticx for ARM64

Currently, the official distribution of [staticx](https://pypi.org/project/staticx/) does not include wheels for the ARM64 platform. Hence, to decrease workload of the workflow, we provide a precompiled wheel for ARM64 in the repository.

To build this wheel, one has to clone the staticx project from https://github.com/JonathonReinhart/staticx set up the project and run

```Python
python3 setup.py bdist_wheel
```

This will produce the a wheel in the `dist` directory. **However** this file cannot be used directly. By default staticx uses `manylinux1` as part of its wheel's filename (this is hardcoded in its setup.py). Python merely checks the filename to figure out if the wheel is suitable for the system it is installed to. `manylinux1` is not supported anymore and does not fit the linux version we are using in our container. Hence we have to rename the file to read `manylinux2010` instead of `manylinux1` since our linux distrubtion in the container is part of the manylinux2010 group.
